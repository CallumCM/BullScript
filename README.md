# BullScript
A template for making coding languages.
### Including:
- An Alexer (more commonly known as a lexer) that mostly works
- A compiler that works 75% of the time
- It's all built in Python for maximal slowness and lag
- Includes basically everything you need to calculate 1 + 1
- This project is literally BS
